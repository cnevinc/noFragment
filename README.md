Sample app for sharing @Android Taipei (2015, 9,23). An opinionated app development architecture. Avoid using multiple fragments and activities and using only one activity with multiple custom views.

Update:
Recently I've found [this artichle from @Piwai](https://corner.squareup.com/2014/10/advocating-against-android-fragments.html) who had elaborated the idea way too better than me. I'll try adopt his idea into my sample in the future.


Note:
 1. Removed embedded view. 
 2. Add activity re-creation handling

Todo:
 1. Add animation when adding a custom view
 2. Try other inmplementation (ex. Flow)
