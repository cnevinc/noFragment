Update:
Recently I've found [this artichle from @Piwai](https://corner.squareup.com/2014/10/advocating-against-android-fragments.html) who had elaborated the idea way too better than me. I'll try adopt his idea into my sample in the future.


Todo:
 1. Handle rotation in onSaveInstanceState() 
 2. Add animation when adding a custom view
